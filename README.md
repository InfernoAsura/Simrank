# SimRank Computation
SimRank is a graph-based measure of similarity introduced by Jeh and Widom in 2004. It quantifies the similarity between nodes in a graph based on the idea that two nodes are similar if they are connected to similar nodes.

# Power Method for SimRank
This repository contains the implementation of the Power Method, which is the simplest iterative approach to compute SimRank scores between nodes. The method works by repeatedly refining the similarity scores of nodes based on the scores of their neighbors until convergence.
